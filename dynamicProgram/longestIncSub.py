Let us discuss Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.
The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence
such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example,
length of LIS for { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

Optimal Substructure:
Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the LIS till index i
such that arr[i] is part of LIS and arr[i] is the last element in LIS, then L(i) can be recursively written as.
L(i) = { 1 + Max ( L(j) ) } where j < i and arr[j] < arr[i] and if there is no such j then L(i) = 1
To get LIS of a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n So the LIS problem
has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
