Method 1: Simple Way
Find common elements in three sorted arrays

Examples:

ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80

ar1[] = {1, 5, 5}
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10}
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: 5, 5

A simple solution is to first find intersection of two arrays and store the intersection in a temporary array, 
then find the intersection of third array and temporary array. Time complexity of this solution is O(n1 + n2 + n3) 
where n1, n2 and n3 are sizes of ar1[], ar2[] and ar3[] respectively.

Method Two: Optimize Way

Find common elements in three sorted arrays
Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

Examples:

ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80

ar1[] = {1, 5, 5}
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10}
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: 5, 5

Let the current element traversed in ar1[] be x, in ar2[] be y and in ar3[] be z. 
We can have following cases inside the loop.
1) If x, y and z are same, we can simply print any of them as common element and move ahead in all three arrays.
2) Else If x < y, we can move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element 
3) Else If y < z, we can move ahead in ar2[] as y cannot be a common element 
4) Else (We reach here when x > y and y > z), we can simply move ahead in ar3[] as z cannot be a common element.
