Write a function to find the n’th Magic number.

Example:

Input: n = 2
Output: 25

Input: n = 5
Output: 130 


If we notice carefully the magic numbers can be represented as 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 etc,
 where 001 is 0*pow(5,3) + 0*pow(5,2) + 1*pow(5,1).
       010 is 0*pow(5,3) + 1*pow(5,2) + 0*pow(5,1)

13. Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of 
bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements.

 Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y.

Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 
( first and last bits differ in two numbers).

21. Modular multiplicative inverse
Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’.

The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that.

 a x ≡ 1 (mod m) 
The value of x should be in {0, 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the ring of integer modulo m.

The multiplicative inverse of “a modulo m” exists if and only if a and m are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, m) = 1).

Examples:

Input:  a = 3, m = 11
Output: 4
Since (4*3) mod 11 = 1, 4 is modulo inverse of 3
One might think, 15 also as a valid output as "(15*3) mod 11" 
is also 1, but 15 is not in ring {0, 1, 2, ... 10}, so not 
valid.

Input:  a = 10, m = 17
Output: 12
Since (10*12) mod 17 = 1, 12 is modulo inverse of 3
